        <div id="div1"><h1> <span class="hi">Hi Everyone and Welcome to my First Website.</span><h1>
            <h2 id=hh> Information about the Website  <h2>
         <p class="red">This website doesn't look like a lot right now, but it will slowly become better as I learn new coding tricks. In case you didn't know, this is the New Mexican Dude That Used to Live in Utah. I hope you Like it!! Enjoy.</p>
<img id="size" src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/landscapes/fields-of-grain.png"> <p class="red" id="dumb"> If I ever learn how, I am going to design this webpage so that people can chat on it, with all my friends from <em>Utah</em> and <em>New Mexico</em>. Thats what is hopefully going to happen this webpage, or at least, thats my plan I have for this. If you guys think that what I have done with this right now is pathetic, just remember that I have only a weeks worth of experiece. so DON'T JUDGE!! <br> <p>
        <p class="red"> But until I learn how to do that, This is going to be my little blog where I tell you guys stuff that happening in my life or something that I heard that is funny or cool. Or some stuff like that. Updates to the website won't happen to much, maybe a few times a month. If you think that I need to update the website, than text me, tell me what you want me to do, and I will do it. If I know how..... </p>
        <p class="red"> Today I learned how to do colors on the website. So if you think that I should change the colors, text or call any time and tell me. I am almost always learning new things, and upgrading the website with the new things I learn. </p>
        <p class="red"> Hey guys as you have probably noticed, I have figured some new stuff out out, such as an outline, how to make boxes, pictures, all sorts of stuff. And, even though I haven't done it on the website, I have learned how to make a scroll box, like, you can use your mouse and scroll down the page. But, the cool thing is that I can make that in the website, make a little extrabox that you can scoll through while staying on the same spot on the website. I hovent done that yet becasue I think that I don't need to use that trick. If you think I should, call me or text me. I'm also always accepting new changes in color and font. Let me know any time.</p>
