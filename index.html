<p class="red"> If I ever learn how, I am going to design this webpage so that people can chat on it, with all my friends from Utah and New Mexico. Thats what is hopefully going to happen this webpage, or at least, thats my plan I have for this. If you guys think that what I have done with this right now is pathetic, just remember that I have only a weeks worth of experiece. so <STRONG><EM>DON'T JUDGE!!</em></STRONG> <br> <p>
        <p class="red"> But until I learn how to do that, This is going to be my little blog where I tell you guys stuff that happening in my life or something that I heard that is funny or cool. Or some stuff like that. Updates to the website won't happen to much, maybe a few times a month. If you think that I need to update the website, than text me, tell me what you want me to do, and I will do it if I know how.. </p>
